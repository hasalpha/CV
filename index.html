            I am a geek with about 10000 hours into coding and bodybuilding
            respectively. I've created a bunch of applications ranging from
            simple single page applications to complex ones that took me months
            to complete. Initially graduated from Anna University, Madras, I
            went on to pursue my masters in Computer Science at the University
            Of Wollongong. There is more to me than what meets the eye. Always
            ready for a challenge and accomplishing hurdles is something that
            I've have got myself used to. Checkout my skills below. For more
            information, Check out my Github
            <strong><a href="https://www.github.com/">Github.com</a></strong
            >. Add me on Codingame.com for any code clashes you may want to
            challenge me for and I'm always up for challenges, Not that I'm
            arrogant or anything, it's just that the website is super fun and
            solving coding challenges stimulates the brain and helps me have my
            problem solving skills in tip-top shape. TLDR: Have fun checking out
            my website.
